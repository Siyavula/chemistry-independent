	  <para>This section studies the use of resources, more specifically phosphate rock, natural gas and other gases (like nitrogen and oxygen) to produce fertilisers to sustain a food supply for people on Earth. The industrial processes that are involved in the manufacturing of fertilisers are studied. The purpose of studying this industry is to make learners aware of the impact of human activities on the environment and our responsibility to use our resources sustainably.</para>
	  <para><emphasis effect="bold">Prior knowledge</emphasis></para>
	  <para>This section of work is done at the end of the Grade 12 year and provides an ideal opportunity to revise some of the concepts covered in redox reactions, rates and extent of reactions, acid-base reactions and balancing of equations. The prior knowledge for this chapter includes a general awareness that the chemistry that is done at school has application in industrial processes in South Africa and elsewhere. Two examples that would have been covered in the electrochemistry section, namely the production of chlorine and the recovery of aluminium metal from bauxite, can provide a useful context to study further application of chemistry in real life. These processes can be mentioned in an introductory lesson. Furthermore, this section also builds on learnersâ€™ prior knowledge of the lithosphere and how we are using these resources on Earth.</para>

	<para>South Africa has a population of over 50 million people, and this number is increasing every year.  Therefore, maintaining healthy crops plays an important role in providing enough food for the nation. Fertilisers are used to provide sufficient nutrients to the soil in order to sustain optimum crop yields. The fertiliser industry is therefore an important chemical industry in South Africa. In this chapter we will investigate what fertilisers are, why they are important, how they are produced and what their impact on the environment is.</para>

	  <title>The importance of nutrients</title>
	  <shortcode>Shortcode</shortcode>
	  <para>Nutrients are very important for life to exist. An <emphasis effect="bold">essential nutrient</emphasis> is a chemical that a plant needs to be able to grow from a seed and complete its life cycle, but that it cannot produce itself. The same is true for animals. A <emphasis effect="bold">macronutrient</emphasis> is a chemical element that is required in <emphasis effect="italics">large quantities</emphasis> by the plant or animal, whereas a <emphasis effect="bold">micronutrient</emphasis> is only needed in <emphasis effect="italics">small amounts</emphasis> for a plant or an animal to function properly.</para>
	  <definition>
	    <term>Nutrient</term>
	    <meaning>A nutrient is a chemical substance used for the metabolism and the physiology of an organism and is absorbed from the environment.</meaning>
	  </definition>
	  <para>In plants, examples of <emphasis effect="italics">macronutrients</emphasis> include carbon (<chem_compound>C</chem_compound>), hydrogen (<chem_compound>H</chem_compound>), oxygen (<chem_compound>O</chem_compound>), nitrogen (<chem_compound>N</chem_compound>), phosphorus (<chem_compound>P</chem_compound>) and potassium (<chem_compound>K</chem_compound>), while <emphasis effect="italics">micronutrients</emphasis> include iron (<chem_compound>Fe</chem_compound>), chlorine (<chem_compound>Cl</chem_compound>), copper (<chem_compound>Cu</chem_compound>) and zinc (<chem_compound>Zn</chem_compound>).</para>
	  <para>Nutrients that plants absorb <emphasis effect="bold">from the soil</emphasis> are called <emphasis effect="italics">mineral nutrients</emphasis>. Mineral nutrients have to dissolve in the water in the soil before plants can absorb them. <emphasis effect="bold">Non-mineral nutrients</emphasis> are <emphasis effect="italics">not provided by the soil</emphasis> itself, but from the environment. For example oxygen and hydrogen can be obtained from rain water, while carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide (<chem_compound>CO_{2}</chem_compound>) is obtained from the air. The source of each of these nutrients for plants, and their function, is summarised in Table <link target-id="tab:chemind:nonmineralnutrientsource"/> (for non-mineral nutrients) and Table <link target-id="tab:chemind:mineralnutrientsource"/> (for mineral nutrients).</para>

	  <para>Animals need similar nutrients in order to survive. However, since animals do not photosynthesise, they rely on plants to supply them with the nutrients they need. Think of the human diet - we cannot synthesise our own food and so we either need to eat vegetables, fruits and seeds (all of which are direct plant products) or the meat of other animals which would have fed on plants. It is important therefore that plants are always able to access the nutrients that they need so that they will grow and provide food for other forms of life.</para>

	  <para>Plants are only able to absorb nutrients from the soil when they are <emphasis effect="italics">dissolved</emphasis> in water so that their root systems can absorb the nutrients. Nitrogen gas (<chem_compound>N_{2}</chem_compound>) for example, cannot be absorbed in the gas form, and needs to be changed into an ion that is soluble in water, for example the nitrate ion (<chem_compound>NO_{3}^{-}</chem_compound>). In the same way phosphorus is absorbed as phosphate ions (<chem_compound>PO_{4}^{3-}</chem_compound>).</para>
	  <para>Plants will grow best in soil that is able to provide sufficient nutrients to them. Natural processes, like the nitrogen cycle, replace nutrients in the soil. However, these natural processes of maintaining soil nutrients take a long time. As populations grow and the demand for food increases, the soil has to supply nutrients faster than the natural processes can sustain. This places more and more strain on the soil to be able to produce a crop.</para>
	  <para>Often, cultivation practices donâ€™t give the soil enough time to recover and to replace the nutrients that have been lost. Today, fertilisers play a very important role in <emphasis effect="italics">restoring soil nutrients</emphasis> so that crop yields can stay high. Some of these fertilisers are <emphasis effect="bold">organic</emphasis> (e.g. compost, manure and fishmeal), which means that they started off as part of something living. Industrial (commercial) fertilisers are <emphasis effect="bold">inorganic</emphasis> (for example ammonium nitrate (<chem_compound>NH_{4}NO_{3}</chem_compound>) or super phosphates (<chem_compound>Ca(H_{2}PO_{4})_{2}</chem_compound>) and have the advantage of being in a <emphasis effect="italics">soluble form</emphasis> that can be absorbed by a plant immediately.</para>

	      <para>As mentioned previously, in South Africa the NPK ratio is expressed in elemental form, for example the P in the ratio refers to the mass of the element phosphorus (P). However, in some countries the ratios are expressed in compound form: <chem_compound>N</chem_compound>:<chem_compound>P_{2}O_{5}</chem_compound>:<chem_compound>K_{2}O</chem_compound>. Nitrogen still refers to the element nitrogen, but phosphorus and potassium refer to the compounds phosphorus pentoxide (<chem_compound>P_{2}O_{5}</chem_compound>) and potassium oxide (<chem_compound>K_{2}O</chem_compound>).

		</problem>
		<solution>
		  <para><correct>No</correct>. New plants need nitrogen (to boost plant growth) and phosphorus (for root growth). An equal NPK fertiliser has equal amounts of N, P and K and therefore would not promote new plant growth as much. An actual starter fertiliser contains much higher amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus (<number>18</number>:<number>24</number>:<number>6</number>).</para>

	    <para>By the <number>20</number>th century, a number of methods had been developed to <emphasis effect="italics">fix</emphasis> atmospheric nitrogen, in other words to make it usable for plants. Sources of nitrogen for fertilisers included <emphasis effect="italics">saltpetre</emphasis> (<chem_compound>NaNO_{3}</chem_compound>) from Chile, and guano. Guano is the droppings of seabirds, bats and also seals. In the early <number>20</number>th century, before the start of the First World War, the Haber process was developed by two German chemists, Fritz Haber and Karl Bosch. They determined what the best conditions were in order to get a high yield of ammonia, and found these to be <emphasis effect="bold">high temperature</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">high pressure</emphasis>. During World War I, the ammonia produced by the Haber process was used to make explosives.</para>
	    <note type="aside">
	      <para>The forward reaction of the Haber process is exothermic, so the forward reaction is favoured by low temperatures. However, low temperatures slow all chemical reactions. So, the Haber process requires high temperatures, and the ammonia is removed as soon as it is formed to prevent it being used in the reverse reaction.</para>

	    </problem>
	    <solution>
	    <para>Fractional distillation is a separation method that uses the difference in boiling temperatures of the components of a mixture to separate those components. The mixture is heated to convert the components into the vapour (gas) phase. The vapour mixture is then pumped into a tall separation column (called a fractional distillation column), usually at the bottom of the column. As the vapour mixture moves up the column and cools, the different components (called fractions) condense as the temperature drops below the various boiling point temperatures. The fractions are collected using collection trays. The fractions can be removed from the mixture in this way and thus the components are separated. This process is used to separate the components of air or crude oil.</para>

	    <title>Organic fertilisers</title>
	    <para>Organic fertilisers are not manufactured by man, but come from natural sources. Examples are manure, blood and bones, guano, compost and kelp products. Organic fertilisers contain lower levels of nutrients and might take longer than inorganic fertilisers to be absorbed as they generally have to degrade first. The advantage of organic fertilisers is that they increase the organic component of the soil. This improves the physical structure of the soil, which in turn increases the soilâ€™s water-holding capacity. The nutrients also tend to be released slower than those of inorganic fertilisers, decreasing their contribution to water pollution.</para>

	    <para>Manure is a  solid waste product from animals that is widely used as an organic fertiliser in agriculture. It contains <emphasis effect="bold">high levels</emphasis> of <emphasis effect="italics">nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium</emphasis> and other nutrients. Manure decomposes over time through bacterial and microbial action and in the process releases these nutrients into the soil. This <emphasis effect="bold">slow release mechanism</emphasis> is a great benefit to farmers as it limits the leaching of nutrients into the ground water, making it available to plants over a longer period of time. Manure also adds organic matter to the soil, <emphasis effect="italics">increasing the quality of the soil itself</emphasis>.</para>
	    <para>Plants can only absorb nutrients that are dissolved in water. When manure decomposes, the nitrogen compounds are converted to a form that is soluble in water, for example nitrates (<chem_compound>NO_{3}^{-}</chem_compound>). The nitrates are dissolved in the moisture in the soil and plants are then able to absorb the nitrogen compounds through their root system.</para>

	    <para>Crop rotation is a farming method that is used to manage the nutrients in soil naturally. When the <emphasis effect="bold">same crop</emphasis> is grown repeatedly in the same place, it eventually <emphasis effect="bold">depletes the soil</emphasis> of specific nutrients. With crop rotation, one type of crop that depletes the soil of a particular kind of nutrient, is rotated with another type of crop which replaces the depleted nutrient. For example, legumes, like beans or peas, have nodules on their roots which contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These bacteria help â€˜fixâ€™ or change nitrogen into a soluble form. Legumes are therefore often alternated with plants requiring nitrogen, and soy beans can therefore be followed by maize.</para>

	  <para>Eutrophication (Figure <link target-id="fig:chemind:algalbloom"/>) is the enrichment of an ecosystem with large quantities of chemical compounds, mostly containing the nutrients <emphasis effect="bold">nitrogen</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">phosphorus</emphasis>. Eutrophication is considered a form of <emphasis effect="bold">pollution</emphasis> because it promotes excessive plant growth, favouring certain species over others. In aquatic environments, the rapid growth of certain types of plants can <emphasis effect="bold">disrupt the normal functioning of an ecosystem</emphasis>, causing a variety of problems. Human society is impacted as well, as health-related problems can occur if eutrophic conditions interfere with the treatment of drinking water. Eutrophication can also decrease the resource value of rivers, lakes, and estuaries.</para>

	    <term>Eutrophication</term>
	    <meaning>Eutrophication refers to an over-supply in chemical nutrients in an ecosystem, leading to the depletion of oxygen in a water system through excessive plant growth. These chemical nutrients usually contain nitrogen or phosphorus.</meaning>
	  </definition>
	  <para>In some cases, eutrophication can be a natural process that occurs very slowly over time.  However, it can also be accelerated by certain human activities.  <emphasis effect="bold">Agricultural runoff</emphasis>, where excess fertilisers are washed off fields and into ground water, and <emphasis effect="bold">sewage</emphasis>, are two of the major causes of eutrophication. The impacts of eutrophication are the following:</para>

	    <item>
	      <para><emphasis effect="bold">A decrease in biodiversity (the number of plant and animal species in an ecosystem)</emphasis></para>
	      <para>When a system is enriched with nitrogen, plant growth is accelerated. When the number of plants increases in an aquatic system, it can block light from reaching deeper water. Plants also consume oxygen for respiration, depleting the oxygen content of the water, which can cause other organisms, such as fish, to die.</para>

By assessing exactly how much fertiliser is needed by crops and other plants, farmers can make sure that they apply only the required amount of fertiliser.

      <title>Chemical equilibrium</title>
      <teachers-guide>
	<para>In this chapter learners will explore the concept of chemical equilibrium in detail. Before starting this chapter it is essential that the learners have a thorough understanding of rates of reactions and chemical kinetics as covered in <link url="todo">Chapter 7</link>. In Grade 11 the definition of equilibrium in physics was covered, it is important that the learners understand the difference between this and a dynamic, chemical equilibrium.</para>
	<para>The following topics are covered in this chapter.</para>
	<list list-type="bulleted">
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold">What the term <emphasis effect="italics">chemical equilibrium</emphasis> means</emphasis></para>
	    <para>In this section learners will be introduced to the concept of chemical equilibrium including everyday examples. Covered under this introduction are the concepts of open and closed systems, and the fact that reactions cannot reach equilibrium in an open system. Chemical equilibrium reactions require reversible reactions that can form a dynamic equilibrium, these concepts are also covered here.</para>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold">The equilibrium constant</emphasis></para>
	    <para>The equilibrium constant is used to determine whether reactants or products are favoured in a reaction at chemical equilibrium. Aside from introducing the meaning of <chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound> values, this section will require the learners to calculate equilibrium constants from known concentrations, as well as to calculate the concentrations of reactants and products. To do that they should use a RICE table. The acronym makes it easier for learners to remember the information necessary, and the table helps them to organise the information they have and see what information they still need.</para>
	    <para>It is important that learners have a thorough understanding of equilibrium constants before they begin <link url="todo">Chapter 9</link>.</para>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold">Le Chatelier's principle</emphasis></para>
	    <para>The concept of understanding how a reaction will be affected by an external stress, without actually doing an experiment, is quite abstract and the learners often struggle with it. Lots of examples with different reactions would be a good idea here to make sure they understand the concepts, before you move on to the more advanced interpretations of graphs. The Haber process could be used as an example to make sure they understand the concepts, before you move on to that section.</para>
	  </item>
	</list>
	<para>The informal assessment in this chapter requires the use of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The learners should be properly instructed on the correct use of safety equipment, including safety goggles, gloves and protective clothing. They should also be reminded not to sniff any chemicals as the fumes can be dangerous as well. More information on laboratory procedures as well as safety precautions is provided in <link url="todo">Chapter 1</link> (Science skills). The inital solution at room temperature should be purple. When heated the solution should turn a deep blue, and when cooled it should turn a pink or red colour.</para>
      </teachers-guide>
      <para>Systems in equilibrium are balanced. For example, if you are running on a treadmill you are in constant motion. However, you are not moving forward or backwards. As fast as you run forward the treadmill is moving you backwards. You are in equilibrium with the treadmill.</para>

      <para>In the same way chemical reactions can be in equilibrium (the products and reactants are produced at the same rate). We will begin by exploring chemical equilibrium in more detail. Ways of measuring equilibrium and the factors that affect equilibrium will be covered.</para>

        <title>What is chemical equilibrium?</title>

	<para>To define chemical equilibrium we need to ask some important questions about reactions:</para>

	    <para>Does a reaction always run its full course so that all the reactants are used up?</para>
	    <list list-type="bulleted">

	    </list>

	    <para>Does a reaction always proceed in the same direction or can it be reversed? In other words, does a reaction always proceed <emphasis effect="italics">reactants <latex>\to</latex> products</emphasis>, or is it possible that a reaction will reverse and go <emphasis effect="italics">products <latex>\to</latex> reactants</emphasis>?</para>
	    <list list-type="bulleted">
	      <item>
		<para>Reactions that go to completion are <emphasis effect="italics">irreversible</emphasis>. However, in some reactions the reactants form products (in a <latex>\textcolor{red}{\textbf{forward reaction}}</latex>), and the products can change back into reactants (in a <latex>\textcolor{red}{\textbf{reverse reaction}}</latex>).</para>

	    <para>Can a reaction reach a point where reactants are still present, but there does not seem to be any further change taking place in the reaction?</para>
	    <list list-type="bulleted">
	      <item>
		<para>In all reactions, as the amount of reactant in a reaction decreases the product is formed more slowly. In a reversible reaction, as the amount of product increases the reactant is formed more quickly.

	<para>Chemical equilibrium is the state of a reversible reaction where the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. While a reaction is in equilibrium the concentration of the reactants and products are constant.</para>

	<para>There are many examples of chemical equilibrium all around you. One example is a bottle of fizzy cooldrink. In the bottle there is carbon dioxide (<chem_compound>CO_{2}</chem_compound>) dissolved in the liquid. There is also <chem_compound>CO_{2}</chem_compound> gas in the space between the liquid and the cap. There is a constant movement of <chem_compound>CO_{2}</chem_compound> from the liquid to the gas phase, and from the gas phase into the liquid. However, if you look at the bottle there does not appear to be any change. The system is in equilibrium.</para>

	<para>Without chemical equilibrium life as we know it would not be possible. Another example of equilibrium in our everyday lives goes on within our very bodies. Haemoglobin is a macromolecule that transports oxygen around our bodies. Without it we would not survive. The haemoglobin has to be able to take up oxgen, but also to release it and this is done through changes in the chemical equilibrium of this reaction in different places in our bodies.</para>

	    <para>The important thing for the students to understand in this experiment is that there is constant movement. Molecules at the surface of the water in the closed beaker are constantly evaporating, and gas molecules are constantly condensing. So although there is no change in the level of the liquid, the total number molecules in the liquid and the gas state remain constant.</para>
	    <para>Point out that the level of water in the sealed container also drops initially, before finally remaining constant. This concept will help learners understand how the rate of the forward reaction decreases until equilibrium is reached.</para>

	      <para>You should notice that in the beaker that is uncovered, the water level drops more quickly than in the covered beaker. This is because of evaporation. In the beaker that is covered, there is an initial drop in the water level, but after a while evaporation appears to stop and the water level in this beaker is higher than that in the one that is open.</para>

	      <para>In the first beaker, liquid water becomes water vapour as a result of evaporation and the water level drops. A small amount of gas molecules will condense again, but because the gas molecules can escape from the system there is much less condensation than evaporation.</para>
	      <para>In the second beaker, evaporation also takes place. However, in this case, the vapour comes into contact with the surface of the glass cover and it cools and condenses to form liquid water again. This water is returned to the beaker. Once condensation has begun, the rate at which the water level drops will start to decrease. At some point, the rate of evaporation will be equal to the rate of condensation, and there will be no change in the water level in the beaker. This can be represented as follows:</para>
	      <para><emphasis effect="bold"><latex>\text{liquid} \rightleftharpoons \text{vapour}</latex></emphasis></para>
	      <para>In this example, the reaction (in this case, a change in the phase of water) can proceed in either direction. In the forward direction there is a change in phase from liquid to gas, present here as water vapour. A reverse change can also take place, when vapour condenses to form liquid again.</para>

	  <para>An <emphasis effect="bold">open system</emphasis> is one in which matter or energy can flow into or out of the system. In the liquid-gas demonstration we used, the first beaker was an example of an open system because the beaker could be heated or cooled (a change in <emphasis effect="italics">energy</emphasis>), and water vapour (the <emphasis effect="italics">matter</emphasis>) could evaporate from the beaker.</para>
          <definition>
            <term>Open system</term>
            <meaning>
	      <para>An <emphasis effect="italics">open system</emphasis> is one whose borders allow the movement of <emphasis effect="bold">energy and matter</emphasis> into and out of the system.</para>
            </meaning>
          </definition>
          <para>A <emphasis effect="bold">closed system</emphasis> is one in which energy can enter or leave, but matter cannot. The second beaker with the glass cover is an example of a closed system. The beaker can still be heated or cooled, but water vapour cannot leave the system because the glass cover is a barrier. Condensation changes the vapour to liquid and returns it to the beaker. In other words, there is no loss of matter from the system.</para>
	  <note type="aside">
	    <para>Generally, some of the molecules at the surface of liquids and solids are moving into the gas phase. This means that matter is leaving the system. However, this is such a small fraction of the total volume of the liquid or solid that a reaction involving only solids or liquids can be considered a closed system.</para>

	  <note type="aside">
	    <para>It is useful to simplify situations in science by dividing the world into the <emphasis effect="italics">system</emphasis> we are studying, and the surrounding environment that might influence the reaction, but is not part of it.</para>

	  <para>Although it is not always possible to observe any macroscopic changes, this does not mean that the reaction has stopped.

        <title>The equilibrium constant</title>
        <shortcode>ESCAZ</shortcode>
	  <para>Consider the reversible chemical reaction:</para>
	  <para><latex display="block">{\text{a}}\textcolor{orange}{\text{A}} + {\text{b}}\textcolor{orange}{\text{B}} ⇌ {\text{c}}\textcolor{purple}{\text{C}} + {\text{d}}\textcolor{purple}{\text{D}}</latex></para>
	  <para><latex>\textcolor{orange}{\text{A}}</latex> and <latex>\textcolor{orange}{\text{B}}</latex> are the reactants, <latex>\textcolor{purple}{\text{C}}</latex> and <latex>\textcolor{purple}{\text{D}}</latex> are the products and a, b, c, and d are the coefficients from the balanced reaction.</para>	  
	  <para>When the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, the system is in chemical equilibrium. It is useful to know how much of each substance is in the container - in particular the amount of products compared to the amount of reactants. A simple ratio from the balanced chemical equation gives us a number called the equilibrium constant (<chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound>).</para>
	  <note type="aside">
	      <para>The subscript <emphasis effect="italics">c</emphasis> refers to the concentration of all the substances at equilibrium.</para>
	    </note>
	  <para><latex display="block">\text{K}_{\text{c}} = \dfrac{{\text{[\textcolor{purple}{\text{C}}\text]}}^{c}{\text{[\textcolor{purple}{\text{D}}\text]}}^{d}}{{\text{[\textcolor{orange}{\text{A}}\text]}}^{a}{\text{[\textcolor{orange}{\text{B}}\text]}}^{b}}</latex></para>
	  <note type="aside">
	    <para>The equation for the equilibrium constant uses the concentrations of the reactants and products. Square brackets mean the concentration of the compound written within the square brackets: <emphasis effect="bold">[</emphasis>x<emphasis effect="bold">]</emphasis> means the concentration of x.</para>
	  </note>
	  <para><latex>[\textcolor{orange}{\text{A}}\text], [\textcolor{orange}{\text{B}}\text], [\textcolor{purple}{\text{C}}\text] \text{and} [\textcolor{purple}{\text{D}}\text]</latex> are the molar concentrations of each substance present at equilibrium.</para>
	  <definition>
	    <term>The equilibrium constant</term>
	    <meaning>
	      <para>The equilibrium constant (<chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound>) is the ratio between the concentration of products and reactants in a chemical reaction.</para>
	    </meaning>
	  </definition>
	  <para>When the concentration of the reactants is much larger than the concentration of the products <chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound> will be small (normally less than one). When the concentration of the reactants is much less than that of the products <chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound> will be large (normally greater than one).</para>
	  <para>For example:</para>
	  <para><latex>2\textcolor{orange}{\text{NO}{\text{(g)}}} + 2\textcolor{orange}{\text{H}_{2}{\text{(g)}}} \rightleftharpoons \textcolor{purple}{\text{N}_{2}{\text{(g)}}} + 2\textcolor{purple}{\text{H}_{2}{\text{O(g)}}}</latex></para>
	  <para>The <latex>\textcolor{orange}{\textbf{reactants}}</latex> are <latex>\textcolor{orange}{\text{NO}}</latex> and <latex>\textcolor{orange}{\text{H}_{2}}</latex>. The <latex>\textcolor{purple}{\textbf{products}}</latex> are <latex>\textcolor{purple}{\text{N}_{2}}</latex> and <latex>\textcolor{purple}{\text{H}_{2}{\text{O}}}</latex>.</para>
	  <para>It is important to look at the coefficients of the equation as well:</para>
	  <para><latex>\textcolor{orange}{\textbf{2}}</latex><chem_compound>NO(g)</chem_compound> + <latex>\textcolor{orange}{\textbf{2}}</latex><chem_compound>H_{2}(g)</chem_compound> <latex>\rightleftharpoons \textcolor{purple}{\textbf{1}}</latex><chem_compound>N_{2}(g)</chem_compound> + <latex>\textcolor{purple}{\textbf{2}}</latex><chem_compound>H_{2}O(g)</chem_compound></para>
	  <para><chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound> for this equation will therefore be written as follows:</para>
	  <para><latex display="block">\text{K}_{\text{c}}=\dfrac{\text{[N}_{2}{\text{]}}{\textcolor{purple}{^{1}}}{\text{[H}}_{2}{\text{O]}}{\textcolor{purple}{^{2}}}}{\text{[NO]}{\textcolor{orange}{^{2}}}{\text{[H}}_{2}{\text{]}}{\textcolor{orange}{^{2}}}}</latex></para>
	  <para>In the expression for <chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound> the concentration of a product or reactant is taken to the power of its coefficient in the balanced reaction. So if the coefficient of a product (C) is 3 in the balanced equation, then the concentration of C ([C]) will be written <chem_compound>[C]^{3}</chem_compound> in the expression for <chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound>.</para>
	  <para>We leave out reactants or products that are either pure <emphasis effect="bold">liquids</emphasis> or in the <emphasis effect="bold">solid</emphasis> phase when calculating <chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound>. For example:</para>
	  <para><latex>\textcolor{red}{\text{C(s)}}</latex> <chem_compound>+ H_{2}O(g)</chem_compound> <latex>⇌</latex> <chem_compound>CO(g) + H_{2}(g)</chem_compound><latex>{\phantom{\rule{40.pt}{0ex}}}\text{K}_{\text{c}}=\dfrac{{\text{[CO][H}}_{2}\text{]}}{{\text{[H}}_{2}\text{O]}}</latex></para>

However, performing an experiment every time to find out would waste a lot of time.

	  <para>When the volume of a system is decreased (and the temperature is constant), the pressure will increase. There are more collisions with the walls of the container. If there are fewer gas molecules there will be fewer collisions, and therefore lower pressure. The equilibrium will shift in a direction that reduces the number of gas molecules so that the pressure is also reduced. So, to predict in which direction the equilibrium will shift to change pressure you need to <latex>\textcolor{darkgreen}{\text{look at the number of gas molecules in the balanced}}</latex> <latex>\textcolor{darkgreen}{\text{reactions}}</latex>.</para>

		  <title>Identify the disturbance or stress on the system</title>
		  <para>Adding <chem_compound>NaCl</chem_compound> produces <chem_compound>Na^{+}</chem_compound> ions and <chem_compound>Cl^{-}</chem_compound> ions as the salt dissolves. Looking at the given equilibrium <chem_compound>Cl^{-}</chem_compound> is in the equation and the disturbance is the increase in concentration of the <chem_compound>Cl^{-}</chem_compound> ion.</para>
		</workstep>
		<workstep>
		  <title>Use Le Chatelier's principle to decide how the system will respond</title>
		  <para>By Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium position will shift to reduce the concentration of <chem_compound>Cl^{-}</chem_compound> ions.</para>
		</workstep>
		<workstep>
		  <title>Decide whether the rate of the forward reaction or the rate of the reverse reaction is increased and state the resulting shift in equilibrium</title>
		  <para>The reverse reaction uses <chem_compound>Cl^{-}</chem_compound> ions and hence the rate of the reverse reaction will increase. The reverse reaction is favoured and the equilibrium will shift to the left.</para>

	<para>In industrial processes, it is important to get the product as quickly and as efficiently as possible. The less expensive the process the better.</para>
        <para>The <emphasis effect="bold">Haber process</emphasis> is a good example of an industrial process which uses the equilibrium principles that have been discussed. The equation for the process is as follows:</para>
	<para><chem_compound>N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g)</chem_compound> <latex>⇌</latex> <chem_compound>2NH_{3}(g)</chem_compound> + energy</para>
	<para>Since the forward reaction is exothermic, to produce a lot of product and favour the forward reaction the system needs to be colder. However, cooling a system slows down all chemical reactions and so the system can't be too cold. This process is carried out at a much higher temperature to ensure the speed of production.</para>
	<para>Because high temperature favours the reverse reaction, the <chem_compound>NH_{3}</chem_compound> product is actually removed as it is made (product concentration decreased) to prevent ammonia being used in the reverse reaction. The decrease of product concentration favours the forward reaction.</para>
	<para>High pressure is also used to ensure faster reaction time and to favour the production of <chem_compound>NH_{3}</chem_compound>. The forward reaction is favoured by higher pressures because there are <number>2</number> gas molecules of product for every <number>4</number> gas molecules of reactant.</para>
	<para>Refer to <link url="todo">Chapter 14</link> for more information on the Haber process and other industrial applications.</para>

	<teachers-guide>
	  <para>In this chapter learners will look at acids and bases. In Grade 11 learners were introduced to a lot of the concepts that are expanded on in this chapter. These include acid and base models and definitions, conjugate acid-base pairs, and some basic acid-base reactions. It is important that the learners have a good understanding of the work covered in <link url="todo">Chapter 8</link>, specifically equilibrium constants, before studying this chapter.</para>
	  <para>New concepts related to acids and bases will also be covered in this chapter. These include pH, more in depth information on titrations and indicators, and real world applications of acids and bases.</para>
	  <para>The following topics are covered in this chapter.</para>
	<list list-type="bulleted">
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold">What are acids and bases?</emphasis></para>
	    <para>This section is largely revision from Grade 11. The Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry models for acids and bases are discussed. Conjugate acid-base pairs are also covered in detail in this section, including worked examples on how to determine the conjugate base of an acid and the conjugate acid of a base.</para>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold">Strong and weak acids and bases, and concentrated and dilute solutions</emphasis></para>
	    <para>The concept of strong and weak acids and bases is often confused with the concept of concentrated and dilute solutions. It is important that the learners understand the difference between these concepts, which are discussed in detail in this section. The exercises will help to determine if the learners truly understand this work.</para>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold"><chem_compound>K_{a}</chem_compound> and <chem_compound>K_{b}</chem_compound></emphasis></para>
	    <para>Although learners will not have encountered these terms before, the idea of an equilibrium constant should be familiar to them after encountering the equilibrium constant (<chem_compound>K_{c}</chem_compound>) in <link url="todo">Chapter 8</link>. The values of <chem_compound>K_{a}</chem_compound> and <chem_compound>K_{b}</chem_compound> should be tied to the ideas of strong and weak acids and bases.</para>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold">Acid-base reactions</emphasis></para>
	    <para>These neutralisation reactions should be familiar to learners from Grade 11. They should revise these reactions through the revision activity provided. It is important that learners undersand how salts are formed from the acid and base, as well as the other products that are likely in each type of reaction.</para>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold">pH</emphasis></para>
	    <para>The pH scale is a logarithmic scale with a base of <number>10</number>. So a change in pH of <number>3</number> is a significant change in the concentration of <chem_compound>H^{+}</chem_compound> ions. A good understanding of pH is also essential to understanding how indicators work. This section covers why a neutralised solution will not necessarily have a pH of <number>7</number>, the concept of <chem_compound>K_{w}</chem_compound>, and the hydrolysis of salts. Indicators are also covered in this section and it important that learners understand how to choose an indicator for an experiment before starting the next section on titrations.</para>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold">Titrations</emphasis></para>
	    <para>Titrations are covered in great detail in this section. This includes learners preparing their own standard solutions, performing several titration experiments, and doing titration calculations. The learners will be working with acids and bases a lot in this section and so should be reminded of proper laboratory safety procedures. Each experiment will take a large amount of time and at least an entire class should be dedicated to these experiments. If possible one class should be for the preparation of a standard solution and the first titration experiment, while another, separate class is for to the second titration experiment.</para>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <para><emphasis effect="bold">Applications of acids and bases</emphasis></para>
	    <para>The applications covered are the production of chlorine in industry and the use of bases in hair products. The production of chlorine is not covered in great detail in this chapter, for more detail see <link url="todo">Chapter 13</link>. The hair care products discussed include: hair permanent waving applications, hair relaxers, and hair dyes. The learners must also perform an experiment using drain cleaners or caustic soda. These products have a high pH and can burn skin. This lesson can also be used to consolidate information by going through the chapter summary and doing the end of chapter exercises.</para>
	  </item>
	</list>
	<para>There are several experiments in this chapter. The learners will be using dangerous chemicals and should be properly instructed on the correct use of safety equipment, including safety goggles, gloves and protective clothing. They should also be reminded not to sniff any chemicals as the fumes can be dangerous as well. More information on laboratory procedures as well as safety precautions is provided in <link url="todo">Chapter 1</link> (Science skills).</para>
	<para>In the informal assessment the learners must determine the temperature change caused by the exothermic reaction of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. They should understand why the temperature stops changing when all the sodium hydroxide has been neutralised.</para>
	<para>The formal assessment requires that the learners prepare a standard solution of sodium hydroxide. It is important that the learners understand why the mass must be known to a high accuracy, why the beakers must be rinsed with water (with the rinsings added to the volumetric flask), why the sides of the volumetric flask must be washed with water, and why it is important to have their eye level with the mark on the volumetric flask when filling to that
	  mark.</para>

	  <para>We encounter many examples of acids and bases in our daily lives. Some common examples of household items that contain acids are vinegar (contains acetic acid), lemon juice (contains citric and ascorbic acid), wine (contains tartaric acid). These acids are often found to have a sour taste. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid are examples of acids that are more likely to be found in laboratories and industry.</para>

	  <para>Hydrochloric acid is also found in the gastric juices in the stomach. Fizzy drinks contain carbonic acid, while tea and wine contain tannic acid. People even use acids in an artistic process known as <emphasis effect="italics">acid etching</emphasis>. In acid etching, a metal is covered in a waxy material that is resistant to acid. The bare metal is then exposed in the desired pattern and the sample is placed in an acid bath. The top layers of the exposed metal are permanently removed, creating the desired image. Some examples of this are shown below (Figure <link target-id="fig:acidsandbases:acidetching"/>).</para>

	  <para>Bases that you may know about include sodium hydroxide (commonly known as caustic soda), ammonium hydroxide and ammonia. Some of these are found in household cleaning products. Bases are usually found to have a bitter taste and feel <emphasis effect="italics">slippery</emphasis> (soap is a good example). Acids and bases are also important commercial components in the fertiliser, plastics, and petroleum refining industries. Some common acids and bases, and their chemical formulae, are shown in Table <link target-id="tab:acids and bases"/>.</para>

	    <title>Arrhenius model for acids and bases</title>
	    <para>A number of models for acids and bases have been developed over the years. One of the earliest was the <emphasis effect="bold">Arrhenius</emphasis> definition. In 1884, Arrhenius discovered that water dissociates (splits up) into hydronium <chem_compound>(H_{3}O^{+})</chem_compound> and hydroxide <chem_compound>(OH^{-})</chem_compound> ions according to the following equation:</para>

	    <para>Arrhenius described an acid as a compound that forms <chem_compound>H_{3}O^{+}</chem_compound> when added to water. An Arrhenius acid therefore increases the concentration of <chem_compound>H_{3}O^{+}</chem_compound> ions ( [<chem_compound>H_{3}O^{+}</chem_compound>] ) in water. Arrhenius described a base as a compound that dissociates in water to form <chem_compound>OH^{-}</chem_compound> ions.

	      <para>You should find that the reaction releases heat and so the temperature increases. After all the base has been neutralised the temperature should no longer increase. This is because the neutralisation reaction is <emphasis effect="italics">exothermic</emphasis> (it releases heat). When all the base has been neutralised there is no reaction on the addition of more acid, and no more heat is released.</para>
	      <teachers-guide>
		<para>After the reaction has finished (the base has been neutralised) there is no more heat being produced. As a result the temperature will not rise any more. In fact, there may even be a decrease in temperature back to room temperature as the heat from the reaction vessel (the beaker) dissipates.</para>

	<para>The concentration of specific ions in solution determines whether the solution is acidic or basic. Acids and bases can be described as substances that either increase or decrease the concentration of hydrogen (<chem_compound>H^{+}</chem_compound>) or hydronium (<chem_compound>H_{3}O^{+}</chem_compound>) ions in a solution. An acid <emphasis effect="italics">increases</emphasis> the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, while a base <emphasis effect="italics">decreases</emphasis> the hydrogen ion concentration.</para>
	<para><emphasis effect="bold">pH</emphasis> is used to measure the concentration of <chem_compound>H^{+}</chem_compound> ions (<chem_compound>[H^{+}]</chem_compound>) and therefore, whether a substance is acidic or basic (alkaline). Solutions with a pH of less than seven are acidic, while those with a pH greater than seven are basic (alkaline). The pH scale ranges from <number>0</number> to <number>14</number> and a pH of <number>7</number> is considered neutral.</para>

It leads to acidification of the blood (acidosis) and can make a person very ill. Some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis are deep and rapid breathing, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In the fight against HIV, lactic acidosis is a problem. One of the antiretrovirals (ARV's) that is used in anti-HIV treatment is Stavudine (also known as Zerit or d4T). One of the side effects of Stavudine is lactic acidosis, particularly in overweight women. If it is not treated quickly, it can result in death.</para>

	<para>In agriculture, it is important for farmers to know the pH of their soils so that they are able to plant the right kinds of crops. The pH of soils can vary depending on a number of factors, such as rainwater, the kinds of rocks and materials from which the soil was formed and also human influences such as pollution and fertilisers. The pH of rain water can also vary, and this too has an effect on agriculture, buildings, water courses, animals and plants. Rainwater is naturally acidic because carbon dioxide in the atmosphere combines with water to form carbonic acid. Unpolluted rainwater has a pH of approximately <number>5.6</number>. However, human activities can alter the acidity of rain and this can cause serious problems such as acid rain.</para>

	<para>This experiment looks at the change in colour of an indicator during an acid-base reaction. It is effectively a very rough titration experiment. Principles that can be applied to titrations, such as adding a small volume of acid, then swirling, can be applied here as well. It is important that the learners understand that the pH range that the indicator changes colour in is not always around <number>7</number>.</para>
	<para>Learners are working with a strong acid and a strong base in this reaction. Concentrated, strong acids and bases can cause serious burns. Please remind the learners to be careful and wear the appropriate safety equipment when handling all chemicals, especially concentrated acids and bases. The safety equipment includes gloves, safety glasses, and protective clothing.</para>

	  <para>The solution changes colour after a certain amount of hydrochloric acid is added. This is because the solution now contains more acid than base and has therefore become acidic. It can be concluded that the indicator is one colour in a basic solution and a different colour in an acidic solution.</para>

      <para>Indicators are chemical compounds that change colour depending on whether they are in an acidic or a basic solution. A titration requires an indicator that will respond to the change in pH with a sensitive and quick colour change. Typical indicators used in titrations are given in Table <link target-id="tab:acidsandbases:indicators"/>.</para>

      <title>What are titrations?</title>
      <para>The neutralisation reaction between an acid and a base can be very useful. If an acidic solution of known concentration (a standard solution) is added to a basic (alkaline) solution of unknown concentration until the solution is exactly neutralised (i.e. there is only salt and water), it is possible to calculate the exact concentration of the unknown solution. It is possible to do this because, at the exact point where the solution is neutralised, stoichiometrically equivalent mole amounts of acid and base have reacted with each other.</para>

      </definition>
      <para>In a <emphasis effect="bold">titration</emphasis>: a known volume of a standard solution (<emphasis effect="bold">A</emphasis>) is added to a known volume of a solution with unknown concentration (<emphasis effect="bold">B</emphasis>). The concentration of <emphasis effect="bold">B</emphasis> can then be determined.</para>
      <para>Acids and bases are commonly used in titrations, and the point of neutralisation is called the <emphasis effect="bold">end-point</emphasis> of the reaction. If you have an indicator that changes colour in the range of the end-point pH then you will be able to see when the end-point has occurred.

	    <para>It is better to have the acid in the burette as many bases will clog the stopcock and damage the burette. It is much easier to clean a burette that has contained acid only. It is important to make sure the burette is perpendicular to the desk and clamped securely.</para>
	    <para>When filling the burette the stopcock should be closed and the funnel should be lifted slightly to allow air to escape, otherwise it will bubble through the liquid in the funnel and splash acid. Once the burette is filled a beaker should be placed underneath and a few centimeters of the solution should be drained through the stopcock. This ensures that the entire burette is full. There should be no air bubbles, as a bubble bursting can affect the volume measurement and disrupt the accuracy of the experiment.</para>

	<para>Although this method will not be as accurate, it will give the learners an idea of what a titration is like.</para>
	<para>Different concentrations of the standard solution may be used, and the calculations will have to be adjusted in that case.</para>
	<para>It is possible to put the sodium hydroxide in the burette and the oxalic acid in the conical flask. This is likely to clog the burette though, so if you do this make sure to wash your burette thoroughly after use to avoid the stopcock being damaged. It may be necessary to drain a few <unit>cm<sup>3</sup></unit> of the oxalic acid to remove all air bubbles from the burette. In this case add more oxalic acid solution to the burette after removing the air bubbles so that the top of the solution is between the <unit_number><number>0</number><unit>cm<sup>3</sup></unit></unit_number> and <unit_number><number>1</number><unit>cm<sup>3</sup></unit></unit_number> marks.</para>
	<para>Learners are working with a strong base in this reaction. Concentrated, strong bases can cause serious burns. Please remind the learners to be careful and wear the appropriate safety equipment when handling all chemicals, especially strong, concentrated bases.

    <para>The chlorine-alkali (chloralkali) industry is an important part of the chemical industry for the production of <emphasis effect="bold">chlorine</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">sodium hydroxide</emphasis>. The most common method involves the electrolysis of a concentrated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (<chem_compound>NaCl</chem_compound>), which is known as <emphasis effect="bold">brine</emphasis>. For more information on electrolysis see <link url="todochapter13">Chapter 13</link>.</para>

    <title>Colouring hair</title>
    <shortcode>Shortcode</shortcode>
    <para>There are many different types of hair colourants, ranging from permanent hair dye to temporary hair dye. Each of them works in a slightly different way.</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted">
      <item>
	<para><emphasis effect="bold">Permanent</emphasis></para>
	<para>In permanent hair dyes there are three main ingredients: a diamino compound (that means two of the amine groups shown in Figure <link target-id="fig:acidsandbases:aminoacid"/> (a)); a coupling agent; and an oxidising agent.</para>
	<para>The oxidising agent is generally hydrogen peroxide (<chem_compound>H_{2}O_{2}</chem_compound>). It oxidises the diamino compound to a state where it can bond with the coupling agent. This process also lightens the hair so that the dye will work more effectively. This new compound is then oxidised again to form the final dye.</para>
	<para>Permanent dyes are basic with a pH between <number>9</number> and<number>11</number> (usually ammonia, <chem_compound>NH_{3}</chem_compound>). The purpose of the base is to open up the hair and allow the small dye molecules to penetrate.</para>
      </item>
      <item>
	<para><emphasis effect="bold">Demi-permanent</emphasis></para>
	<para>These dyes use ethanolamine or sodium carbonate as a base. These are less harsh bases than ammonia (pH between <number>8</number> and <number>9</number>), and so do not allow the dye to penetrate as far into the hair.</para>
	<para>They still contain a hydrogen peroxide developer that lightens the hair slightly. However, they cannot colour dark hair to a lighter colour. The hair colour will look more natural though, as the natural colour of the hair will affect the final dye. Demi-permanent dyes last a long time (at least <number>12</number> washes), but will eventually wash out.</para>
	<para>Demi-permanent hair dyes do not damage the hair as much as permanent dyes.</para>
      </item>
      <item>
	<para><emphasis effect="bold">Semi-permanent</emphasis></para>
	<para>These dyes contain molecules that are small enough to partially penetrate the hair without the need of a base to open the hair. They last for about <number>4</number> - <number>5</number> washes and have, at most, very low levels of hydrogen peroxide or ammonia. They will not lighten hair and the final colour depends a lot on the original colour and the porosity of the hair.</para>
      </item>
      <item>
	<para><emphasis effect="bold">Temporary</emphasis></para>
	<para>These are generally bright dyes. They are composed of large dye molecules, which are unable to penetrate the hair. These large molecules <emphasis effect='italics'>stick</emphasis> to the hair and usually can be removed with just one wash. If the hair is already dry or damaged the colour may last longer, as the damaged hair is more open and allows the dye molecules to penetrate.</para>

      <para>Although they are common house hold items, drain cleaners and caustic soda are extremely corrosive. Learners are working with a strong base and concentrated, strong bases can cause serious burns. Please remind the learners to be careful and wear the appropriate safety equipment when handling all chemicals, especially concentrated bases. The safety equipment includes gloves, safety glasses, and protective clothing.</para>
